    - And use Awesome leetcode features for notes - 1.) md notes 2.) Individual submission notes..
    - use study plan - Set 'n' number of questions to practise and choose any day of the week!
    - 📌 you don't need anything system outside leetcode 📌
    
- ⭐️ Just write all notes while solving problems in a single file than later use AI to categorize them.
- ⭐️ Can use copilot chat to search for what you are looking for from your notes

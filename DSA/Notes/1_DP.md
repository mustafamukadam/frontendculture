# Notes

- ⭐️ memo key = argument to function = node value
  ⭐️ memo value = return value for that function call - unique set of arguments -> give particular result - go to exact return expression and add answer to memo object before return
- Alvin DP video - make notes of complexity explanation
- Also learn tabulation - all Alvin problems in second half of the video are solved using tabulation

- 📝 For a person who understands binary trees, it won't take long to do binary tree exercises. So if you can't or are afraid of working out questions, you can start from the binary trees. The first 10 may be a little uncomfortable. If you do another 20 with the framework, you may gain some understanding. If you finish that, and then do any backtracking, dynamic programming or divide-and-conquer topic, you will find that as long as recursion is involved, it's all a tree problem.
- do the exercises of the relevant topics of trees first. Try to see the problems in relation to the framework, rather than by focusing on details

- Generally an array is used as a memo, of course you can use hash table (dictionary), the thought is the same.
- The example of the Fibonacci sequence is not strictly a dynamic programming because it does not involve finding the optimal value.

- There are two ways to implement a DP algorithm:

Bottom-up, also known as tabulation -> Implemented using iteration.
Top-down, also known as memoization -> Implemented using recursion.

- Just focus on structy for both DP and Graph - it's enough

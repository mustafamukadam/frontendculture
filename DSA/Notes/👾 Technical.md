# Tips to solve problems

- Comment code and create template/story as much as you can for every category of problems! https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/5f6b5d99-9616-4a35-a452-94eac143aab6_1659794761.1005166.png
- Create commented template to solve particular kind of problem. Then maybe, pick questions and fill in those places.
- Follow Story format
- Try to solve problems using multiple algorithms, backtracking, DP (both) if possible.

- Weekly Contests <- How do I measure my performance, I am solving questions but am I improving

- Try following this format - just follow Explore cards: DP, Array, Graph, Top Interview Q, Recursion ..

- Amazon likes to ask simple, basic array questions.
  We highly recommend you to practice First Unique Character in a String, which is a popular question being asked.
  We also recommend Integer to English Words.

Master the sliding window technique that applies to many substring or subarray problems.
The sliding window is a very intriguing technique used to solve some of the complex problems involving an array or a string

- Tips to consider
  https://github.com/SeanPrashad/leetcode-patterns
  For eg-
  If input array is sorted then

  - Binary search
  - Two pointers

- Whenever u have N2 Brute Force solution, 1 technique is to try sorting the input.

‚≠êÔ∏è in keyword for if(str[fast] in needed) // needed={...}

// The pseudo code of the common structure to solve recursive problems is as below:
function helper(node, other_information) {
// basic case, such as node is null
if node is null:
return things like 0 or null
else:
do something relates to helper(node.left) and helper(node.right)
}
function answerToProblem(root) {
return helper(root, other_information)

- ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Write inline comments in leetcode programs

- use any github project as image placeholder to add image to leetcode notes.

- what is Todo status in Panel in problem Description page?

- ‚≠êÔ∏è use consistent variable name, for eg, always o1[k] in hashmaps.

- Folder structure:
  - Algorithms
  - Data Structure
  - Pattern (educative)
- Use only 2 platforms to track problems/progress to keep it simple and easy: 'Leetcode' and 'vscode'
- Save and memorize javascript tips/code/string methods etc. that are handy for solving problems
- Keep taking notes about what a problem is teaching you. Keep revisiting them. Spaced repitition helps in committing things to memory.

# More

- when interviewers ask follow up questions on a problem or ask for an alternative solution.

- ‚≠êÔ∏è I can use Js [] as stack if I commit to use operations that manipulate same end of the array (i.e. push and pop)
- In recursion, base case is really just a scenario where don't have a recursive call.
- ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è There is NO way to do a BFS recursively (because of Stack in recursion, and stack = DFS)

# Dynamic Programming

- ⭐️ memo key = argument to function = node value
  ⭐️ memo value = return value for that function call - unique set of arguments -> give particular result - go to exact return expression and add answer to memo object before return
- Alvin DP video - make notes of complexity explanation
- Also learn tabulation - all Alvin problems in second half of the video are solved using tabulation

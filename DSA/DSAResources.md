# 5. Tips

- ⭐️⭐️⭐️ see topic of problem in Leetcode problemset -> Settings icon > "Show topic tags"
  - in leetcode extension you can see tags right there in question page
- ⭐️ use consistent variable name, for eg, always o1[k] in hashmaps.

- Folder structure:
  - Algorithms
  - Data Structure
  - Pattern (educative)
- Use only 2 platforms to track problems/progress to keep it simple and easy: 'Leetcode' and 'vscode'
- Save and memorize javascript tips/code/string methods etc. etc. that are handy for solving problems
- ⭐️⭐️ Very high. You’re not trying to be familiar with the specific questions you’re asked in the interview, you’re trying to be familiar with the TYPE of question you’re asked in the interview. If you practice for long enough, you’ll come to realize that there’s only a couple dozen different types of questions that you can be asked. You should be trying to master each type of question so that no matter what flavor they throw at you, you can solve it.

### Leetcode

- use leetcode extension for free premium features 😍
- Use leetcode playground
- use session (eg for swiggy)
